The evidence is saying \"It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many trade names worldwide.\" The word \"and\" is joining two ideas together, so we can split the evidence into two parts. Part A is \"It is available as a generic medication.\" Part B is \"It is sold under many trade names worldwide.\" We can see that Part A is true because the medication is available as a generic. Part B is also true because it is sold under many trade names worldwide. Therefore, the entire claim is true.",
