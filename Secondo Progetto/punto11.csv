5,"The first sentence is the claim and the second sentence is the evidence. The evidence is saying ""It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many trade names worldwide."" The word ""and"" is joining two ideas together, so we can split the evidence into two parts. Part A is ""It is available as a generic medication."" Part B is ""It is sold under many trade names worldwide."" We can see that Part A is true because the medication is available as a generic. Part B is also true because it is sold under many trade names worldwide. Therefore, the entire claim is true.",4
